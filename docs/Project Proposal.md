### **Problem Statement**
GPS tags can improve searching for stolen items by reducing the amount of money and time it takes to find the missing item, being more affordable, and having privacy features that only allow the owner to view its location.
Ideally, any stolen item would be trackable to prevent further theft and to recover stolen items. Unfortunately, searching for stolen items can be time-consuming and not cost-effective, sometimes never turning up at all. Stolen vehicles can sometimes take more than a week to find.
In 2019, approximately $6.4 billion in vehicle thefts and approximately $3 billion was stolen from Walmart each year (Borelli, 2021 & Thomas, 2021). To combat this, affordable GPS tags with privacy features to only allow the owner to view the location can be placed on the items. Once they are stolen, they can be tracked and recovered.
Theft is a major problem that plagues society and many businesses, resulting in billions lost every year. By implementing GPS tags for individuals and businesses, the overall losses will be reduced.


### **Project Description**
GPS tags will be used to track commonly misplaced or valuable items, and I will be creating an app that can track the tags through a wireless internet connection. The tags will be created using available hardware that anybody can buy. The tags will be displayed on a map in the app. Only the owner will be allowed to view the location of the tag.  The app will allow the owner to share the location of their tag with whoever they choose and they will be able to post information on their missing item into a forum allowing others to be on the lookout for it.


### **Proposed Implementation Language(s)**
Python will be the Language used because of the wide variety of information and sources that use Python. HTML will be used for the webpage/app interface.
Libraries, Packages, Development kits, etc. to be used in the proposed implementation languages 
* PubNub API for its geolocation features


### **Additional Software/ Equipment Needed**
* OpenStreetMap Software 
* Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
* Neo 6M GPS module
* Connector wires


### **Personal Motivation**
I work in a retail store and there have been many instances where people have walked out with expensive products. It gets very frustrating when people steal things and get away with it and by creating a tracking tag, the thieves can be caught and the product returned to the owner. 

### **Outline of Future Research Efforts**
Configure the Prototype tracker, test its functionality making sure it works properly, then create an actual GPS tracker that will be used, make an app/webpage where the location of the tracker can be shown, and connect the data from the tracker to the app/webpage, and add features to “share item’s location” and a forum for missing items. To share an item’s location, the user will click a button to share the location and then choose a contact or enter a phone number to share the location with. The forum for missing items will show a picture of the item, a description of the item and any unique identifying features, the estimated date and time it was stolen, and the owner’s contact information so they can be notified if their item has been found.
