# Custom GPS Tags and Mobile Tracking App

GPS tags will be created, using available hardware, to track missing or commonly misplaced items. An app will also be created that will be used to track the tags. In the app, the user will have the ability to share the location of their tag(s) and will have access to a forum where they can post information on a missing item for other people to watch out for.
